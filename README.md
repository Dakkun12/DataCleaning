Project: Housing Data Cleaning in SQL

Aspiring Data Analyst: Gregory Hendrica

In this project, I focused on cleaning housing data using SQL. The dataset included various attributes such as property details, sale information, owner information, and other relevant data points.

Objective:
The main objective of this project was to clean and organize the housing data, ensuring its accuracy and consistency for further analysis.

Approach:

Data Assessment: I carefully examined the housing dataset to understand its structure and identify any inconsistencies or missing values.
Data Cleaning: Using SQL, I performed various cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.
Quality Assurance: Throughout the cleaning process, I conducted quality checks to validate the accuracy and completeness of the cleaned data.
Outcome:
By the end of the project, I successfully cleaned the housing data, resulting in a structured and reliable dataset ready for further analysis. The cleaned dataset contains essential information about properties, sales, owners, and other relevant attributes, making it valuable for various analytical tasks.

Key Learnings:

Enhanced proficiency in SQL for data cleaning and manipulation, particularly in the context of housing datasets.
Gained practical experience in identifying and resolving data quality issues, ensuring the integrity of the analytical process.
Improved understanding of the importance of data preparation and quality assurance in data analysis projects, especially when dealing with complex datasets.
This project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in data cleaning and prepared me for more advanced analytical tasks in the field of data analysis.
